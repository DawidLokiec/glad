# My GLAD
GLAD is a simple OpenGL loader library that provides a uniform API across multiple platforms, allowing developers to use OpenGL without worrying about platform-specific details.

The purpose of this repository is to provide an easy way to incorporate GLAD into other projects using CMake and git submodules. 
Additionally, it allows for compiling GLAD without the `-pedantic` compiler flag, **without having to compromise on that flag in other projects**.
